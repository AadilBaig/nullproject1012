Project Description:
This project is a Number Memorization Game. The goal of the game is to read and memorize the sequence of numbers which get displayed on the screen for a short amount of time, then the user/player will try and enter the numbers which they remember. The more sequences the user/player gets correct, the more numbers they have to memorize. The sequence will be made, confirmed and stored on the server side. After the player gets the sequence wrong three times, they are faced with an end screen that presents their highest score.

Functional Requirements: 
-	Three different buttons choosing difficulty of game (Easy, Medium, Hard)
-	When the start button is clicked, the game begins on the currently chosen difficulty (Default Easy)
-	Regarding the difficulty, the sequence of numbers shown appear for 3/4/5 seconds respectively
-	While the number sequence is being shown, a timer will count down on screen underneath the sequence respective to the difficulty
-	After each turn, the new number sequence will increase in digits
-	If the user enters a wrong number sequence, they will lose a life and are shown the original number sequence as well as their input. 
-	If the user enters the correct number sequence, they will be shown the original sequence as well as their answer.
-	“Continue” button which allows the user to attempt the next level 
-	Once the player gets the sequence incorrect 3 times, end screen is displayed with most recent score, highest score.
-	“Try again” button at end screen which restarts the game
- “Quit” button at end screen which exits to main menu
