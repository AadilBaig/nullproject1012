Project Description:
This project is a Number Memorization Game. The goal of the game is to read and memorize the sequence of numbers which get displayed on the screen for a short amount of time, then the user/player will try and enter the numbers which they remember. The more sequences the user/player gets correct, the more numbers they have to memorize. The sequence will be made, confirmed and stored on the server side. After the player gets the sequence wrong three times, they are faced with an end screen that presents their highest score, as well as the average time to submit an answer.

Functional Requirements: 
 - User can see the welcome screen
 - Instructions for play are displayed
 - User clicks the start button
 - First sequence of numbers is displayed
 - User has 4.5 seconds to memorize the sequence
 - User then gets prompted to enter the sequence that they remember
 - Screen displays correct sequence as well as the user input, shows if you advance to the next level or if you got it incorrect
 - Once the player gets the sequence incorrect 3 times, end screen is displayed with highest score, and average time to submit an answer
 - Player is then prompted to try again, or quit
