Project Description:
This project is a Number Memorization Game. The goal of the game is to read and memorize the sequence of numbers which get displayed on the screen for a short amount of time, then the user/player will try and enter the numbers which they remember. The more sequences the user/player gets correct, the more numbers they have to memorize. The sequence will be made, confirmed and stored on the server side. After the player gets the sequence wrong three times, they are faced with an end screen that presents their highest score, as well as the average time to submit an answer.

Functional Requirements: 
 - User can see the welcome screen
 - User can access the game
 - User can see a series of numbers
 - User can see a textbox to enter the sequence after the original sequence is no longer visible
 - Game works with no errors
 - User can see an end screen
