        This project is a Number Memorization Game. The goal of the game is to
        read and memorize the sequence of numbers which get displayed on the
        screen for a short amount of time, then the user/player will try and
        enter the numbers which they remember. The more sequences the
        user/player gets correct, the more numbers they have to memorize. The
        sequence will be made, confirmed and stored on the server side. After
        the player gets the sequence wrong three times, they are faced with an
        end screen that presents their highest score, as well as the average
        time to submit an answer.
